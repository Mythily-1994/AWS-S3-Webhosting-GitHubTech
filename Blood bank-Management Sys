📘 BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – FULL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
1. Project Title
Smart Blood Bank Management System – Donor & Patient Record Automation
2. Abstract
The Smart Blood Bank Management System is a lightweight web-based application designed to maintain donor information, patient requests, blood stock details, and transaction records.
The application helps hospitals, organizations, and blood banks manage operations efficiently by providing features such as donor listing, patient registration, search and filtering, data import/export, and record maintenance.
The project is hosted on AWS S3 (Static Hosting) and optionally uses AWS EC2 for backend expansion.
3. Objective

•	To maintain accurate and up-to-date blood availability records.
•	To speed up emergency blood requirement search.
•	To reduce manual paperwork and human errors.
•	To allow exporting/importing of donor & patient data.
4. Scope
This system can be used in:
•	Hospitals
•	Clinics
•	Blood donation camps
•	NGOs
•	Rural health centers
•	Supports:
•	Multi-blood group tracking
•	Donor/patient history
•	Secure data backups
5. Features
🔹 Donor Management
•	Add / Update / Delete donor details
•	Fields: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Group, Mobile, Address, Last Donation Date
•	Donor list table with sorting
•	Export donor list as CSV
•	Import donor data
🔹 Patient Management
•	Patient registration
•	Blood requirement details
•	Hospital reference
•	Status tracking
🔹 Search & Filters
•	Search by name
•	Filter by blood group
•	Clear search results
🔹 Data Operations
•	Export CSV
•	Import CSV
•	Print donor/patient list
•	Download report
🔹 Technology
	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Storage: AWS S3 website hosting
	Backend (Optional): AWS EC2 (Node/Python/PHP)
	Authentication (Optional): AWS Cognito
6. System Architecture
Option 1 – S3 Static Hosting Only
User → Browser → S3 Static Web Hosting → Data Stored in JS/CSV
Option 2 – S3 + EC2 Backend
User → Browser → S3 UI → API → EC2 Server → RDS/Local DB
7. AWS Implementation
🔹 S3 Static Hosting Steps
Create S3 bucket → enable static website hosting
Upload HTML, CSS, JS files
Make bucket public
Add bucket policy
Get website URL → Use in resume

🔹 EC2 Setup for Backend
Launch EC2 Ubuntu
Install Apache/Node/Python
Upload backend files
Connect UI to backend API

🔹 Cognito Authentication (Optional)

Example Cognito Domain Name:
bloodbank-auth-myl-trichy.auth.ap-south-1.amazoncognito.com
Uses:
Login
Signup
Session management
8. Database Design
Table 1 – Donors
Column	Type
donor_id	Auto ID
name	Text
age	Number
gender	Text
blood_group	Text
mobile	Number
address	Text
last_donation	Date
Table 2 – Patients
Column	Type
patient_id	Auto ID
name	Text
required_blood_group	Text
hospital	Text
mobile	Number
date	Date
